# Ground Floor üè¢

Ground Floor is a simulation game that allows you to create and manage a company. Players will make decisions, hire employees, and develop business plans with the help of AI-generated elements. The game progresses through various stages, from company creation to boardroom discussions, all powered by large language models. Ground Floor is currently hosted at [groundfloor.games](http://groundfloor.games).

## Gameplay

1. **Name your company**
2. **Describe what your company does**
3. **Potential company roles are generated, based on your description**
4. **Pick which roles you want to hire for, and how many**
5. **Profiles are generated for you to hire from**

   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">a. Five skills are generated for each unique job role</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">b. Skill levels are randomly generated from 1 to 10 for each skill</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">c. A randomly generated picture is pulled from thispersondoesnotexist.com</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">d. A salary is generated based on the position and skill levels üõ†Ô∏è</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">e. A personality is generated for each profile</p>

6. **A business plan is developed**

   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">a. The hired employees enter a "boardroom" to discuss and develop a business plan for the company</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">b. Each employee is assigned an LLM agent, influenced by their personality and skill levels</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">c. A calculation determines how much each person talks during meetings. For example, a CEO with an assertive personality might talk 60% of the time, while a developer with a timid personality might only talk 10% of the time</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">d. The conversation proceeds with turns determined by the talk ratio, simulating a real boardroom discussion, ending with a decision on a business plan</p>

The gameplay plan is still being built out. Development is currently at step 5d.
